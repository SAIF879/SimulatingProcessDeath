#ðŸ§  Simulating Process Death in Android

Ever wondered what happens when Android decides to randomly kill your app to reclaim memory?  
This project helps you **simulate process death** and observe how lifecycle, state restoration, and `ViewModel` + `SavedStateHandle` behave when your app is *terminated* and later *resurrected*.

##  What This Project Demonstrates

- How Android handles app **process death**
- What happens to state stored in `ViewModel`
- How to use `SavedStateHandle` to **restore state**
- Why `onDestroy()` isn't always called
